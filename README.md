# Don
Call me "Don" or "Don Robert".

ðŸ¤– I enjoy working on robotics/mechatronics projects and games.

ðŸ“£ Please feel free to brag to me about your projects or expertise! I enjoy listening to and learning from passionate people. Project criticism and PRs are welcome in any of my public repos.

ðŸŽ² Some statements I believe:
- Reusing old hardware > buying the latest and greatest.
- A good mentor can learn from mentees.
- Humans will still write code in the year 2077.
